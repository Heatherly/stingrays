<h1>All About Stingrays</h1>

<img src="stingray.JPG" alt="Stingray"><h2>Stingrays are my favorite sea creature!</h2>
<p>With flat, wide bodies, stingrays may not look like fish, but they are!</p>
<p>They can be found in tropical and subtropical waters, because they like it shallow and warm. Theyâ€™re usually hidden on the seafloor. But each of the 60 species of stingrays are fascinating in their own way.</p>
