<h1>All About Stingrays</h1>

<img src="stingray.jpg" alt="Stingray"><h2>Stingrays are my favorite sea creature!</h2>
<p>With flat, wide bodies, stingrays may not look like fish, but they are!</p>
<p>They can be found in tropical and subtropical waters, because they like it shallow and warm. They’re usually hidden on the seafloor. But each of the 60 species of stingrays are fascinating in their own way.</p>
